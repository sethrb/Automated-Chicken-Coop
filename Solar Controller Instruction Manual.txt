Part One, Main Features
  1. intelligent control with single chip and professional software.
  2. with precise battery discharge control by use of battery discharge features. Different discharge rated with different final voltage.
  3. with over charge, over discharge, short circuit, over load, wrong connection auto protection. When the above mention functions work, it won't destroy any components of the controller , it won't burn the fuse.
  4.to use series connectrion PWM circuit, it is 3%-6% more effective than non-PWM circuit when charging. To use float charging control mode to prolong the system life span; with high precision temperature compensation function. 
  5.with LED to show the battery state.
  6. to use industrial grade chip, it can work under environment such as cold, high temperature, humid, at the same time, it uses a crystal oscillator timeing control, the timing control accurately. 
  7. to use LED display and settings, one button can carry out all settings.
  8. to use Flash memory to keep record of all the working control point to make the settings digitalized. 
  9. with DC discharge or IHZ strobe flash discharge mode which is especially suitable for traffic light control etc.

Part Five, Working Mode Settings
  1. Setting methods:
    to press the power swtich for 5 seconds, the MODE will show LED flashing number, to shop pressing, to press each time there will be a     number, till thenumber you needed, and the LED number stop flashing, setting finished. Every time your press it, the LED is No. Bright.
  2. Only Light control MOde, "0"
    When ther is no sunshine the light grade comes down to starting point, the controller will switch on the load in 10 min after you ahve confirmed the signal. When there is sunshine, the light grade comes up to stopping point, The controller will switch off the load in 10 min after have confimed the signal.
  3. Light Control+time delay mode ("1"-"15")
    Starting process is the same as the above mentioned, when the load works till the fixed time it will be switched off. Time setting, please refer the following table. Light control enjoys priority
  4. General Control Mode "16"
    The Mode cancel the light control, time contorl function, output delay and related function, to keep all the other functions, to take as a common general use controller.
  5. Setting ways "17" 
    To use for system setting, it is the same aws the only light control mode, to cancel the 10 min delay function, all the others are the same. When there is sunshine, the load is switched on, when there is no sunshine, the load is switched off, and it is convenient to check the system when doing installation and setting.
  6. Output mode Instruction
    When the LED shows the setting mode figure, is "1"-"15", it is only DC output
